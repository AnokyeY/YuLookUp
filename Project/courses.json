Python has a variety of libraries in different domains allowing for the solution of interesting problems which has made it a popular language in industry and the academy. Students do hands-on work to design, write, debug and test computer programs that solve problems computationally. Students study variables, assignments, expressions (arithmetic, relational and logical) and sequencing of statements to implement solutions for computational problems, in Python. They document programs with comments and preconditions. They analyze the type correctness of programs via a type checker. They use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to develop, unit-test and debug programs given a problem specification. They apply conditionals (including nested conditionals) to implement algorithms to solve computational problems. They code functions to develop modular programming solutions for computational problems. They apply Python loops (including nested loops) to implement algorithms to solve computational problems. They apply data structures, including tuples, sets, lists and dictionaries, to implement algorithms to solve computational problems.

The enormous size of todays data sets and the specific requirements of modern applications necessitated the growth of a new generation of data management systems, where the emphasis is put on distributed and fault-tolerant processing. New programming paradigms have evolved, an abundance of information platforms offering data management and analysis solutions appeared and a number of novel methods and tools have been developed. This course introduces the fundamentals of big data storage, retrieval, and processing systems. As these fundamentals are introduced, exemplary technologies are used to illustrate how big data systems can leverage very large data sets that become available through multiple sources and are characterized by diverse levels of volume (terabytes; billion records), velocity (batch; real-time; streaming) and variety (structured; semi-structured; unstructured). The course aims to provide students with both theoretical knowledge and practical experience of the field by covering recent research on big data systems and their basic properties. Students consider both small and large datasets because both are equally important and justify different trade-offs. Topics include: software frameworks for distributed storage and processing of very large data sets, MapReduce programming model, querying of structured data sets, column stores, key-value stores, document stores, graph databases, distributed stream processing frameworks.

This course, is designed to help students harness their creative potential by stimulating their own creative process, in order to help them develop ideas that create real value and have a positive impact on society. Creativity can be applied across many disciplines, and this course is designed for students from all faculties, with enhanced learning opportunities fostered through projects delivered in cross disciplinary teams. The course will help students learn how to observe and frame critical problems, and then identify and choose potential solutions that can be implemented by individuals or organizations. As a consequence of participating in this course, students will become an innovation enabler in any type of organization, or better able to use their own creativity to create a startup. Students will start by exploring their own creativity and problem solving style, before being introduced to creative problems solving frameworks, tools and processes, which they can deploy while solving real problems, both individually and in teams.

Sensory systems are explored with respect to the function, the principles of the underlying information processing, and their physiological implementation in the organism. To understand the value of specialized sensory systems, the course also discusses the context in which sensory systems are used, and the constraints that may limit their evolution. Technical solutions to sensory problems in robotics are discussed and compared to those invented by natural evolution.

We begin by studying how gravity triggers fusion reactions in starts that create heat, light, and every element in our bodies except hydrogen: overall, stars shine by converting mass into energy (Einsteins E\u003dmc^2). We discuss how we can use the corpses of stars (white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes) to probe how space and time are related via Einsteins theories of relativity. We examine how stars are bound together into galaxies by gravity and how to use various wavelengths of light to determine why there are different types of galaxies: elegant spirals, massive ellipticals, and faint dwarf galaxies. We learn how the Doppler effect reveals that dark matter must produce some of the gravity that binds stars into galaxies, galaxies into clusters of galaxies, and clusters of galaxies into superclusters. We explore how we can use distant galaxies to study the development of the universe over its entire history, including the increasing importance of dark energy. We confront both the earliest instants and the far future of our universes history: what we know, what we still hope to learn, and what we think we can ever learn.

For each case we first cover a primer on the technical issues - for instance learning how a gene codes for a protein - so that after this course when you come across such material youll be better able to correctly grasp the relevant points. But we also study the enduring tension between expertise and democratic populism, the distinction between risk and uncertainty, and whether ignorance is a lack of knowledge....or the wrong knowledge confidently held.
